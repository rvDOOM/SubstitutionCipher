# SubstitutionCipher
This program answers question 1 from my first assignment in my CSC 426 Cryptography class. 

"The ciphertext below was encrypted using a substitution cipher. Using letter frequency analysis method of the English language (see Table 1.1 in Sect. 1.2.2), find the substitution table (the key), and decrypt the ciphertext into the corresponding plaintext (you should add spaces and punctuations for the plaintext). Note that the text is relatively short and that the letter frequencies in it might not perfectly align with that of general English language from Table 1.1. â€¨

This question must be done by computer programs that you write in any computer programing language, but preferably C or C++. Your submssion should include source code ( eg., in .c, .cpp) and running results (the substitution table, plaintext)."

The cipher text is included in the repository.
